Display Resting-State Correlations
==================================

In this example, we show how to build up a complex visualization of a
volume-based image showing resting-state correlations across the whole brain
from a seed in the angular gyrus. We'll plot several views of both hemispheres
in a single window and manipulate the colormap to best represent the nature of
the data.
