======================
Display an fMRI Volume
======================

To plot data on the surface that is stored as a volume image, it is only
slightly more complicated. You'll have to use the function
``surfer.project_volume_data``, which makes an external call to the Freesurfer
program ``mri_vol2surf``.

Note: In PySurfer versions 0.4 and lower, the project_volume_data function must
be imported from ``surfer.io``.
