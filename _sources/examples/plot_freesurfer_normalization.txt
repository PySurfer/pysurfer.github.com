Plot Freesurfer Normalization
=============================

This example shows how PySurfer can be used to examine the quality of
Freesurfer's curvature-driven normalization to a common template.

We are going to plot the contour of the subject's curvature estimate after
transforming that map into the common space (this step is performed outside
of PySurfer using the Freesurfer program ``mri_surf2surf``).

With a perfect transformation, the contour lines should follow the light/dark
gray boundary on the fsaverage surface. Large deviations may reflect problems
with the underlying data that you should investigate.
