Introduction
============

PySurfer is a Python library for visualizing cortical surface representations
of neuroimaging data. The package is primarily intended for use with
`Freesurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_, but it can plot data that
are drawn from a variety of sources. PySurfer extends `Mayavi's
<http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/index.html>`_ powerful rendering 
engine with a high-level interface for working with MRI and MEG data.
